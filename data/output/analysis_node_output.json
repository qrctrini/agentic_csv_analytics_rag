Average expenditures for auto insurance in the United States have generally been increasing year-over-year from 2003-2021, with a few exceptions during economic downturns like 2007-2009.\n\n2. The rate of increase has varied, ranging from around 0.5-1% per year in some periods to over 6% in others, like 2016-2017.\n\n3. There were year-over-year decreases in average expenditures during the late 2000s recession (-2.3% in 2007, -1% in 2008) and the COVID-19 pandemic (-2.4% in 2020).\n\n4. The overall trend shows expenditures rising from around $800 in 2003 to over $1000 by 2021, a increase of over 25% even after adjusting for the temporary decreases.\n\n5. The consistent upward trajectory likely reflects increasing costs for insurance providers from factors like vehicle repair costs, medical expenses, litigation, and natural disasters impacting claims.\n\nSo in summary, while displaying some volatility based on economic conditions, auto insurance expenditures have experienced a clear upward trend over the past two decades in the United States."
