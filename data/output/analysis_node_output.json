There are a few years of small declines, but the overall trajectory is upwards.\n\n- The rate of increase has fluctuated year-to-year, ranging from around 1-2% up to 6-7% in some years like 2016 and 2017.\n\n- The largest percent increases tended to occur after years of slower growth or declines, potentially as rates re-adjusted upwards.\n\n- In 2020, expenditures declined around 2-2.5% likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and disruptions to driving/insurance. But they rebounded in 2021.\n\nKey statistics:\n- Average expenditure in most recent year (2021): $1061.54\n- Highest expenditure: $1071.74 in 2019 \n- Percent change range: -2.4% (2020) to +6.7% (2017)\n- Average annual percent change (2012-2021): Around 3.2%\n\nSo in summary, auto insurance costs have trended upwards over the past decade-plus, with some fluctuations in the rate of increase year-to-year, and a temporary pandemic-related dip in 2020 before resuming increases."
